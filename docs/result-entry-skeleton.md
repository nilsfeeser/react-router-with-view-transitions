# Result Entry Skeleton Implementation

## Overview

The Result Entry Skeleton feature provides a loading state visualization for product entries in the application. It ensures a smooth user experience by preventing layout shifts during data loading and providing visual feedback to users.

## Problem Statement

When loading product data, there are several challenges to address:

1. Layout shifts during content loading
2. Visual feedback for users during loading states
3. Smooth transitions between loading and loaded states
4. Handling of dynamic content heights

## Solution

The Result Entry Skeleton feature implements a comprehensive loading state system that:

1. Shows a placeholder skeleton while content is loading
2. Maintains consistent layout dimensions during loading
3. Provides smooth transitions between states
4. Handles dynamic content heights automatically

## Technical Implementation

### Component Structure

The feature consists of three main components:

1. `ResultEntry`: The main container component
2. `ResultEntryContentView`: The actual content display
3. `ResultEntrySkeleton`: The loading state visualization

### Skeleton Hook

The feature uses a custom hook to manage the skeleton state:

@see: use-result-entry-skeleton.tsx

## Benefits

1. **Smooth Loading Experience**: Provides visual feedback during loading states
2. **Layout Stability**: Prevents layout shifts during content loading
3. **Consistent Dimensions**: Maintains consistent heights during transitions
